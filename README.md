# HTML Components
===============

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/szgabsz91/html-components/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/szgabsz91/html-components/latest)

A reusable component library written in HTML and Dart.

A sample application can be found on Google App Engine that demonstrates most of the features of the components: http://html-components.appspot.com

The sample application is currently using the old web_ui package. I have started porting every component to the new Polymer.dart and when I finish, the sample application will be updated too.
