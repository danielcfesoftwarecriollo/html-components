Former world number one Lee Westwood came closest to breaking par but bogeyed the last to finish with a one-over 73 after being drawn in the latest group and playing when conditions were at their toughest. "I played nicely, just didn't make enough of the par-fives, even par is not good enough on the par-fives." U.S. Open champion Justin Rose shot a 76, as did Ian Poulter and the two amateurs, Matthew Fitzpatrick and Garrick Porteous, while David Lynn signed for a 78. "Some of the pin locations today were very hard to keep it under the hole, so you find yourself on key holes around this golf course where you're putting downhill." Fitzpatrick and Porteous finished tied with Australia's Oliver Goss as the leading amateurs after overcoming nervous starts to shoot four-over.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/donald-penalized-masters-officials-003722198--golf.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2014 20:37:22 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">donald-penalized-masters-officials-003722198--golf</guid></item><item><title>Mickelson's bad 'mental' day puts him eight back</title><description>By Larry Fine AUGUSTA, Georgia (Reuters) - Phil Mickelson blamed a bad "mental" day and a lack of tournament sharpness for a four-over-par 76 on Thursday that matched his worst opening round at the Masters.

He went on to lose to Bubba Watson in a playoff and missed the cut last year before his ailing back started to play up.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/golf-oosthuizen-back-hunt-masters-233452238--golf.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2014 19:34:52 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">golf-oosthuizen-back-hunt-masters-233452238--golf</guid></item><item><title>Police investigating NFL quarterback Kaepernick after complaint by woman</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/police-investigating-nfl-quarterback-kaepernick-complaint-woman-230939114--nfl.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/RzCLToGewVUzSFuhrm6UUg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-04-10T230939Z_1_CBREA391SC600_RTROPTP_2_NFL.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="NFL: NFC Championship-San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks" align="left" title="NFL: NFC Championship-San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Zachary Fagenson MIAMI (Reuters) - Miami police said on Thursday that they are investigating San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick after a woman filed a police report claiming that she had drinks with him and two other football players and awoke in a hospital with no memory of the night.

Haas, 31, first played the fabled layout when he was in high school, his great uncle Bob Goalby won the 1968 title and his father Jay Haas, a former Ryder Cup player and nine-time PGA Tour winner, played in 22 Masters with five top-10 finishes. Following in the family business, Haas has won five times on the PGA Tour and won at some memorable venues, including Riviera, Congressional and at the Tour Championship in 2011 on his way to winning the FedExCup and its $10 million prize. "My great uncle, my dad's uncle, Bob Goalby, won the Masters in 1968, and I think it's been a special place in our family since then," he said, recalling trips to watch his dad play.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/haas-makes-more-masters-memories-family-224833857--golf.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2014 18:48:33 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">haas-makes-more-masters-memories-family-224833857--golf</guid></item><item><title>Dufner makes nine on 13th hole at Masters</title><description>Because of his ultra laidback approach to golf, Jason Dufner's body language is often harder to read than the greens at Augusta National.

The 31-year-old Haas, whose great uncle Bob Goalby landed the coveted Green Jacket in 1968, recovered from a bogey five at the opening hole to set the pace with a four-under 68.

The 31-year-old Haas, whose great uncle Bob Goalby landed the coveted Green Jacket in 1968, recovered from a bogey five at the opening hole to set the pace with a four-under 68.

Couples says on winning Masters at 54</title><description>By Larry Fine AUGUSTA, Georgia (Reuters) - Fred Couples carried on his love affair with Augusta National by shooting a one-under 71 in Thursday's first round of the Masters and then posed a question that would have thrilled his legion of fans. I love the course and I would say my 71 is in pretty darn good shape." Couples, 54, is playing in his 30th Masters and has played well at Augusta in recent years, leading some to wonder if he might be able to take over as the oldest Masters winner from Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won his sixth in 1986. It was also a strong day for Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez, 50, who made the turn at four under par before stalling at Amen Corner with a bogey at 11 and a double-bogey at the par-three 12th to join Couples on 71. Scotsman Sandy Lyle, the 1988 winner, reached three under par by the fourth hole with three successive birdies before slipping back.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/why-not-couples-says-winning-masters-54-204850473--golf.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2014 16:48:50 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">why-not-couples-says-winning-masters-54-204850473--golf</guid></item><item><title>Masterful starts by debutants Stadler, Blixt and Walker</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/masterful-starts-debutants-stadler-blixt-walker-200150898--golf.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/cNvGr0nSLryffPjyWLI7hw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-04-10T200150Z_1_CBREA391JN800_RTROPTP_2_CSPORTS-US-GOLF-MASTERS-DEBUTANTS.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Sweden&amp;#039;s Jonas Blixt hits his tee shot on the ninth hole during the first round of the Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta" align="left" title="Sweden&amp;#039;s Jonas Blixt hits his tee shot on the ninth hole during the first round of the Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Mark Lamport-Stokes AUGUSTA, Georgia (Reuters) - The Masters has been won by only three debutants since the tournament was launched in 1934 but Jonas Blixt, Kevin Stadler and Jimmy Walker made impressive starts on Thursday to raise expectations of a fourth. First-timers Stadler, Blixt and Walker all recorded two-under-par 70s in the opening round to climb into early contention for the year&amp;#039;s first major, taking advantage of relatively calm morning conditions in dazzling sunshine.

The burly American was joined soon after by Swede Blixt, who had teed off one group behind, before Walker also got to two under with a sizzling run of four consecutive birdies from the par-five 14th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/masterful-starts-debutants-stadler-blixt-walker-200150898--golf.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2014 16:01:50 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">masterful-starts-debutants-stadler-blixt-walker-200150898--golf</guid><media:content url="http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/cNvGr0nSLryffPjyWLI7hw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-04-10T200150Z_1_CBREA391JN800_RTROPTP_2_CSPORTS-US-GOLF-MASTERS-DEBUTANTS.JPG" type="image/jpeg" width="130" height="86"></media:content><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/masterful-starts-debutants-stadler-blixt-walker-200150898--golf.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/cNvGr0nSLryffPjyWLI7hw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-04-10T200150Z_1_CBREA391JN800_RTROPTP_2_CSPORTS-US-GOLF-MASTERS-DEBUTANTS.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Sweden&amp;#039;s Jonas Blixt hits his tee shot on the ninth hole during the first round of the Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta" align="left" title="Sweden&amp;#039;s Jonas Blixt hits his tee shot on the ninth hole during the first round of the Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Mark Lamport-Stokes AUGUSTA, Georgia (Reuters) - The Masters has been won by only three debutants since the tournament was launched in 1934 but Jonas Blixt, Kevin Stadler and Jimmy Walker made impressive starts on Thursday to raise expectations of a fourth.
